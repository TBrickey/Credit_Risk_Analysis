# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we have oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm, a combination using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we have compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

## Results:
